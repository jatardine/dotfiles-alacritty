# Yet Another Alacritty Theme

![](https://github.com/jatardine/dotfiles-alacritty/blob/main/alacritty-xfce4-term-demo.png)

This is a default theme I use across all of my machines, including my Acer Aspire 5749Z.

### Dependencies

- alacritty (duh)
- isokeva-custom (any [Isokeva font](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) works but `fonts.toml` needs to be edited)

## Potentially FAQ

**Q: Why does the demo screenshot show Xfce Terminal alongside Alacritty?**

A: My Xfce Terminal uses the same color scheme but always relies on bright colors (`colors.bright` in Alacritty). It's just a demo of what bright colors look like in practice. (Also my Vim still is calling Xfce Terminal and I can't be bothered to change that.

**Q: What's that toolbar / what WM are you using in the demo?**

It's a customized Fluxbox. You can find the configuration [here](https://github.com/jatardine/dotfiles-fluxbox-acer).
